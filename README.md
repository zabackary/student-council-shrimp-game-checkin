# Shrimp Game Check-in

This is a iced/nokhwa powered photo booth app to check in teams for a student council event at Christian Academy in Japan.
At American schools, the student council is expected to host productions/events every once in a while. This is for one of them.

It's based off code I used for a photo booth at a different event but it has been rebranded.

I hereby license this repo under the GPLv3. Exceptions will be granted if you ask.
